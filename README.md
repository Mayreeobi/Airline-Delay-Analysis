# AIRLINE-DELAYS-ANALYSIS (SQL Project)

## Introduction
Flight delays are a critical issue in the aviation industry, leading to financial losses, operational inefficiencies, and customer dissatisfaction. This project analyzes real-world flight delay data to uncover trends, identify root causes, and provide actionable insights to improve airline operations and enhance passenger experiences.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delay data to:

- Identify busiest months and airports for flights.
- Determine which months experience the highest delay rates.
- Explore delay patterns across different airlines.
- Examine primary causes of delays, including weather, carrier issues, and late aircraft.
- Assess the impact of weather on delays at various airports.
- Compare delay occurrences during peak and off-peak seasons.
- Investigate geographical patterns in delay trends (e.g., coastal vs. inland airports).
- Identify airports and airlines with the best on-time performance.

## Data Source
- Dataset: FP20 Analytics January 2025 Challenge 
- Link: [Airline Delay Dataset](https://github.com/Mayreeobi/AIRLINE-DELAYS-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Airline_delay_dataset.xlsx)

## Data Analysis: 
The analysis explores key metrics,utilizing SQL scripts and data exploration to uncover trends and insights:

- Flight Traffic: Total number of flights handled, busiest months, and airports with the highest flight volume.
- Delay Trends & Causes: Calculating monthly delay percentages, identifying delay patterns by airline, and breakdown of delay reasons (weather, carrier, late aircraft).
Geographical & Seasonal Patterns: Analyzing weather-related delays by airport and region, comparing delays during peak and off-peak seasons, and identifying regional patterns (e.g., coastal vs. inland airports).
- On-Time Performance & Operational Efficiency: Determining the percentage of flights delayed over 15 minutes, identifying the best-performing airports and airlines.

## Findings & Recommendations
## Key Findings:
- Busiest Periods and Airport: January 2023 recorded the highest traffic with 68,883 flights, with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) being the busiest airport.
- Some airlines have consistently lower on-time performance, requiring operational improvements.
- Weather-related delays significantly affect specific airports and regions.
- Late aircraft delays contribute a large share to overall flight disruptions.
  
## Recommendations:
- Optimize Flight Scheduling: Adjust flight operations based on historical delay trends to reduce congestion.
- Improve Airline Efficiency: Airlines with high delays should enhance turnaround times and operational processes.
- Weather-Responsive Planning: Airports heavily affected by weather should invest in better forecasting and contingency planning.
- Passenger Communication: Implement real-time delay alerts and improved customer service to manage passenger expectations.
